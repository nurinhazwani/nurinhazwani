## **Reflections**

### **SECP1513: Technology and Information Systems**
1. **What I Gained**: This course has provided valuable insights into the integration of technology in industries like energy, sharpening both technical and analytical skills.
2. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Including more hands-on activities or guest lectures from tech leaders could enhance the learning experience.
3. **Personal Reflections**: I enjoyed applying theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and collaborating with peers on creative projects.

### **SECJ1013: Programming Technic 1**
1. **What I Gained**: This course helped me improve my programming skills, especially in C++ and Java. I learned important concepts like algorithms and how to solve problems using code.
2. **Suggestions for Improvement**: It would be better if the course included more hands-on coding exercises and examples from real-life situations to help understand how to apply what we learn.
3. **Personal Reflections**: enjoyed the challenge of coding and figuring out how to make my programs work. Working with classmates also taught me new ways to solve problems, and I feel more confident in my programming abilities now.

### **SECI1013: Discrete Structure**
1. **What I Gained**:  This course helped me understand the mathematical concepts that form the foundation of computer science, such as sets, logic, and functions. It made me realize how important these concepts are for problem-solving in programming.
2. **Suggestions for Improvement**:  The course could benefit from more practical examples and exercises to show how these mathematical ideas are used in real-world scenarios, especially in programming.
3. **Personal Reflections**: Although the course was challenging at times, I found it interesting to see how math and logic apply to programming. It gave me a better understanding of how computer algorithms work, which I find useful for my future projects.

### **SECR1013: Digital Logic**
1. **What I Gained**: This course helped me understand how computers process information using logic gates and circuits. I learned how binary numbers work and how different logic operations are used to design circuits.
2. **Suggestions for Improvement**: It would be helpful to have more hands-on practice with building circuits or simulations to better visualize how digital logic is applied in real systems.
3. **Personal Reflections**: While some topics were difficult, I enjoyed learning how digital systems function at the hardware level. This knowledge will help me in understanding how computers and other electronic devices work.
